This project is an Android application that uses gesture recognition to support basketball shooting training. The app is intended to serve basketball players as a tool to support shooting training by allowing touchless input of shooting results using Thumb Up and Thumb Down gestures. Additionally, it provides the option to analyze training sessions and monitor progress by storing data
locally.
